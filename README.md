# Docker-Scuttlebot
A DockerFile to setup a Scuttlebot instance with a persistent data folder.

#Requirements

Docker.

#Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Max-Github/Docker-Scuttlebot.git
cd Docker-Scuttlebot
./build
```

#Usage

From within the checked out folder run:

```bash
./start
```

This will start a docker image in interactive mode with Scuttlebot running (a pub).

You can either split the window, or create a new window within byobu to manage the Scuttlebot instance.
